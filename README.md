# Project's Title

This mini project is a tutorial from my medium blog. This tutorial will bring you to the Regular Expression (regex) wolrd. It is going to show you how to implement or create a pattern of regex operations in real scenarios.


# Project Description

In this mini project, we're going to build a pattern of Regex operations to check input formats for Email and phone number. The input formats have to be
following a set of given rules. A structure of program, it will read a set of inputs and call a function to implement the Regular Expression with them for checking a pattern. During checking, the program will be able to identify result of each one that corrent or not on a user's screen. If you would to get more information and explanation of my code in detail, please check my medium blog [link](https://medium.com/@natakornch/regular-expression-for-beginners-d5e3e4bbeb3)

## Pattern requirements

### Email
- Email address can be any stings
- Domain of email must be “testmail” (xxx@testmail.xxx)
- At the end of domain email can be only two forms which are “.com” or “.net”

### Phone number
- alphabet is not allow to include in a phone number 
- a phone number that starts with "08", its length is 10 digits 
- a length of phone number is 9, it is only for the number of starting with "02"

# Prerequisite
Before running the code, you need to install a set of prerequisite on your system.
-	Python3 with a library of Regular Expression
-	Any preferred editor tool (I recommend a jupyter notebook)

# Deployment

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
